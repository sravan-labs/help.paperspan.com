Once you've installed the **PaperSpan Chrome extension** and logged in, saving articles is quick and flexible.

## Save the Current Page

1. Click the **PaperSpan icon** in your browser toolbar.  
   _(The toolbar is the row of icons near the address bar.)_

2. A list of your folders will appear.  
   Click on any folder name to **save the current page** directly to that folder.

> **Tip:** Want to always save to your default folder?

- **Right-click** on the **PaperSpan extension icon** and choose **Options**.
- Enable the checkbox:  
  `✓ Save directly to Read Later folder`
- Now, just clicking the icon will instantly save the page to your **Read Later** folder — no folder selection needed.

## Save a Link Within a Web Page

While browsing any web page:

1. **Right-click** on any link you'd like to save (without opening it).
2. Select **“Save to PaperSpan”** from the menu.

✅ The link will be saved directly to your **Read Later** folder.

This is perfect for bookmarking articles or resources without having to open them in a new tab.
