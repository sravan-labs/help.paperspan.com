## How It Works

- The app **automatically downloads** your articles after you save them.
- Articles are saved in a **clean, readable format**, ready to be accessed even with no internet.
- No manual steps are needed — it's all handled in the background.

---
## Why It’s Useful

- Read during travel, commutes, or areas with poor connectivity
- Never lose access to saved content
- Helps you stay focused — no distractions from being online

> 📂 Articles are stored locally and take up minimal space.

## Initial Sync Note

If you just logged into the app and have a large reading list, it may take a few minutes for all articles to finish downloading in the background. You can continue using the app while this happens.
