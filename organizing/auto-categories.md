# Auto-Categories

PaperSpan automatically assigns categories to your saved articles using intelligent content analysis. These categories help you discover themes like Technology, Health, Finance, etc., without manual tagging.

- Tap a category to view all matching articles.
- Categories are assigned at the time of saving and are available across platforms.

> **Note:** Articles **imported from Pocket** will **not have auto-categories assigned initially**. You can still organize them manually using folders.

> 📱 Available on **Android** and **iOS**.
